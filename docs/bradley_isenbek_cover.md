Hello!

I'm your typical non-typical developer. While I've spent 15+ years architecting production systems that process billions of data points and handle millions of messages daily, what really drives me is the work I do in my garage lab—where I turn constraints into innovation and curiosity into working systems.

Case in point: I recently scored 60 Raspberry Pis from a failed business. Most people would resell them. I built a distributed investigation tool with 40 Pi4 workers running a VPN cluster with Tor DNS lookup and headless browser automation. Thirty nodes run OpenWRT, ten run Bookworm. I'm currently training models to inject dynamic code into Playwright for full-auto web tasks, using CDX toolkit for lead seeding. It's messy, it's scrappy, and it works.

I'm an integrator at heart. I dumpster dive for gear because working within constraints forces creative solutions. I run my own DNS server on a Frankenstein Linux box I built from salvaged parts. I host everything locally because I want to understand how it all fits together. I built [Vectl](https://github.com/tinymachines/vectl) to replace bloated utilities because sometimes the best tool is the one you make yourself.

Some current projects that keep me up at night:

- **TRNG using a Thorium source**—generates cryptographic-quality random bitstreams, runs hourly Diehard and NIST statistical tests ([hotbits.tinymachines.ai](https://hotbits.tinymachines.ai)). Fair warning: I'm not an interface guy, but I'm getting better.

- **Custom 802.11 protocol** for bouncing data around a decentralized network—because sometimes you need to route around traditional infrastructure.

- **Built [oym.nominate.ai](https://oym.nominate.ai)** recently for my current role—it works, and my UI chops are improving with every project.

- **Figured out how to integrate Claude into my workflow** as an actual co-worker, not just a code completion tool.

My day job involves Python, Bash, and Snowflake—architecting data systems that scale. But my garage lab is moving toward C, Go, and ARM assembly because I want to get closer to the metal. My lab isn't a static setup; it's an instrument I play, constantly in flux as I tear things down and rebuild them better.

I bring this same mindset to production work: find elegant solutions, question assumptions, build tools that last. Whether it's processing 4.9 billion data points, architecting high-availability messaging platforms, or leading classified government projects, I approach every problem as an opportunity to build something that actually works.

I'd love to discuss how this combination of production experience and maker mentality could contribute to your team.

Best regards,
