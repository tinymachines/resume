## 👋 About Me

I'm not your typical developer. I build production systems that process billions of data points by day, and run experiments with salvaged hardware in my garage lab by night. I believe the best solutions come from understanding constraints, questioning assumptions, and getting your hands dirty.

15+ years architecting distributed systems, processing massive datasets, and leading technical teams. But what really drives me is the work between the lines—the custom protocols, the dumpster-dived hardware turned into distributed computing clusters, the "what if I just..." projects that turn into production tools.

## 🔬 Current Projects & Lab Work

### Distributed Investigation Tool
![Investigation Tool]
*60-node Raspberry Pi cluster (40 Pi4 workers, 30 OpenWRT + 10 Bookworm). VPN/Tor architecture with headless browser automation. Currently training models to inject dynamic Playwright code for full-auto web tasks using CDX toolkit for lead seeding.*

### True Random Number Generator
![TRNG System]
*Thorium-based cryptographic TRNG with hourly Diehard and NIST statistical validation. Generates cryptographic-quality random bitstreams. Live at [hotbits.tinymachines.ai](https://hotbits.tinymachines.ai). Interface design is a work in progress—I'm getting better at UI, I promise.*

### Custom Networking & Infrastructure
![Lab Setup]
*Custom 802.11 protocol for decentralized network data routing. Self-hosted infrastructure on a Frankenstein Linux box built from salvaged parts. Running my own DNS because understanding how things fit together matters.*

### Production Work
![Production Systems]
*Day job: Python, Bash, Snowflake—architecting data systems that scale. Recent project: [oym.nominate.ai](https://oym.nominate.ai). My UI chops are improving with every build.*

## 🛠️ Tech Philosophy

**Work Within Constraints** - Dumpster diving for gear isn't just about saving money. Constraints force creative solutions. The best tool is often the one you build yourself.

**Understand the Full Stack** - From ARM assembly to cloud architecture. From custom protocols to production APIs. You can't optimize what you don't understand.

**Lab as Instrument** - My garage lab isn't static. It's constantly in flux, torn down and rebuilt as experiments evolve. It's not a workspace—it's an instrument I play.

**Tools Over Frameworks** - Built [Vectl](https://github.com/tinymachines/vectl) to replace bloated utilities. Sometimes the right tool doesn't exist yet. So you make it.

## 💭 Philosophy

> "One is always a student."

I believe in understanding how things work from first principles. Whether it's processing billions of data points in production or building a distributed cluster from salvaged Raspberry Pis, the approach is the same: question assumptions, work within constraints, build tools that last.

The lab isn't separate from the work. It's where production ideas are born, where constraints breed creativity, and where curiosity turns into working systems.
